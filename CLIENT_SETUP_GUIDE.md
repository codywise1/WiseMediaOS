# Client Account Setup Guide

## Automatic Client Account Creation

When you add a new client through the admin dashboard, the system automatically:

1. **Creates a user account** with the email you provide
2. **Sets the default password** to: `WiseMedia33`
3. **Creates a client record** in the database
4. **Links the account** to the client profile

## How to Add a New Client

### From Admin Dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Clients** page
2. Click **"Add Client"** or **"Create New"**
3. Fill in the client information:
   - **Name** (Required) - e.g., "John Smith"
   - **Email** (Required) - e.g., "john@example.com"
   - **Phone** (Optional)
   - **Company** (Optional)
   - Other fields as needed
4. Click **"Save"** or **"Create Client"**

### What Happens Automatically:

✅ User account is created with email + password `WiseMedia33`
✅ Client record is added to database
✅ Client can now log in and see their data
✅ You can assign projects, invoices, appointments to them

## Client Login Instructions

Share these credentials with your new client:

```
Portal URL: [Your Portal URL]

```

**Recommend**: Ask clients to change their password after first login.

## What Clients See

When a client logs in, they ONLY see:
- Their own profile
- Projects assigned to them
- Invoices for their account
- Their scheduled appointments
- Their proposals
- Their support tickets

They **CANNOT** see:
- Other clients' data
- Admin functions
- Other clients' projects/invoices

## Admin (You) Access

Your account (icodywise@gmail.com):
- Sees ALL clients and data
- Can create/edit/delete everything
- Master control over the system
- Full access to all features

## Default Password

All new client accounts use: **`WiseMedia33`**

Make sure to communicate this to your clients securely!

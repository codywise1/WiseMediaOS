1. Update auth role types and demo login to include `staff` and creator roles (`elite`, `pro`, `free`) consistently.
2. Refactor navigation (Layout/Sidebar) to use grouped items per role (admin, staff, client, member) without exposing restricted sections.
3. Update component user role unions/usages that assume only `'admin' | 'user'` to include `staff` (and creator roles where relevant) to clear type errors.
